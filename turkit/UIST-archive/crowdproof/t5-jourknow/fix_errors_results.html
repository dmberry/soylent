Recording a fragment of text simply requires picking up a pen or typing at a keyboard.  When we enter text, each (pen or key) stroke is being used to record the actual information we care about---none is wasted on application navigation or configuration.  The linear structure of text means there's always an obvious place to put anything---at the end.  And the free form of text means we can record anything we want to about anything, without worrying whether it fits some application schema or should be split over multiple applications.  All of this means that we have to do less to record text, which makes it more efficient and also less of an interruption and distraction than using a complex application.</pre>
